  ? Definition list
  : Definition lists vary only slightly from other types of lists in that list items consist of two parts: a term and a description. The term is given by the DT element and is restricted to inline content. The description is given with a DD element that contains block-level content. [Source: W3C]
  ? Definition list w/ multiple paragraphs
  :: The style sheet provided with this plugin will render these paragraphs...
  .. ... to the left of the term being defined.
    ? Definition list w/ multiple "paragraphs"
    : Another way to separate blocks of text in a definition...
    : ... is to simply have multiple definitions for a term (or group of terms).

  : This definition list has DD tags without any preceding DT tags.
  : Hey, it's legal XHTML.
  ? Just like DT tags without following DD tags.
  ?? But DT tags can't contain paragraphs. That would __not__ be legal XHTML.
  
  .. If you try, the result will be rendered oddly.
